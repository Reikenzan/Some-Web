use the template in this folder to format the dbview.php page.
That page is already connected to the dbStyle.css provided.

Make it look as much like the template as possible, because we're doing this rushed we
can't make more than two-three pages unless one of you has the time.

Someone must also create an "Onclick" actionlistener and function for the purchase button.
The button should take the user to a seperate page that is styled and finished.
This person will also add additional entrys to the "animal" database by logging in to it.
We only have two entrys currently and need more.
The instructions to login are in the access information folder

add whatever else if you can think of anything that suits the page

Summary*****There are 3 tasks
1)dbview page should look like the website template. Use backgrounds and colors that go
with the tables or change the table css to accomodate.

2)Create and style a page called dbPurchase. 
*Note
I'll do any database variables the purchase page needs once i get home at 9 tomorrow.
-Ignore- the need for any variables if you need to and focus on that page looking great.


3)Add Onclick functionality to the purchase button that takes you to the dbPurchase page
After adding that, use google and wikipedia to add more animal entrys to the
 cpais47368_groupProg_Animal table. Don't mess with the tables variables, only add
 more entries. Look at the access information folder or lab 10 to find out how to reach the table.
It's on phpmyadmin.


I'll add a © TM Produced by footer when finished with our names and roles in the project

additionally:
Add on-hover effects and color gradients if you remember how to where possible.
