	  <h3>Most Common Genres</h3>
		<p><strong>Action:</strong>
			Plays out mainly through a clash of physical forces. Frequently these stories have fast cuts, tough characters making quick decisions and usually a beautiful girl nearby. Anything quick and most likely a thin storyline.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Adventure:</strong>
			Exploring new places, environments or situations. This is often associated with people on long journeys to places far away encountering amazing things, usually not in an epic but in a rather gripping and interesting way.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Comedy:</strong>
			Multiple characters and/or events causing hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Dementia:</strong>
			Anime that have mind-twisting plots.</p>

		<p><strong>Demons:</strong>
			Anime that are set in a world where demons and other dark creatures play a significant role - the main character may even be one.</p> 

		<p><strong>Drama:</strong>
			Anime that often show life or characters through conflict and emotions. In general, the different parts of the story tend to form a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, the story has a message that is bigger than just the story line itself.</p>

		<p><strong>Ecchi:</strong>
			Anime that contain a lot of sexual innuendo. It is about panties (pantsu) and bra/breast showing, situations with "sudden nudity" and of course, subtle hints or sexual thoughts. Ecchi does not describe actual sex acts or show any intimate body parts except for bare breasts and buttocks. Ecchi is almost always used for humor.</p>

		<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong>
			Anime that are set in a mythical world quite different from modern-day Earth. Frequently this world has magic and/or mythical creatures such as dragons and unicorns. Frequently fantasies describe tales featuring magic, brave knights, damsels in distress, and/or quests.</p>

		<p><strong>Game:</strong>
			Anime whose central theme is based on a non-violent, non-sports game, like go, chess, trading card games or computer/video games.</p>

		<p><strong>Harem:</strong>
			Anime that involves one lead male character and many cute/pretty female support characters that ends up living together within the same household. The lead male typically represents the average guy who is shy, awkward, and girlfriendless. While each female character surround the lead male possesses distinct physical and personality traits.</p>

		<p><strong>Historical:</strong>
			Anime whose setting is in the past. Frequently these follow historical tales, sagas or facts.</p>

		<p><strong>Horror:</strong>
			Anime whose focus is to scare the audience.
			
		<p><strong>Kids:</strong>
			Anime whose target audience is children. This does not necessarily mean that the character(s) are children or that an anime whose main character(s) are children is appropriate for this genre.</p>

		<p><strong>Magic:</strong>
			Anime whose central theme revolves around magic. Things that are "out of this world" happen - incidents that cannot be explained by the laws of nature or science. Usually wizards/witches indicate that it is of the "Magic" type. This is a sub-genre of fantasy.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Martial Arts:</strong>
			Anime whose central theme revolves around martial arts. This includes all hand-to-hand fighting styles, including Karate, Tae-Kwon-Do and even Boxing. Weapons use, like Nunchaku and Shuriken are also indications of this genre. This is a sub-genre of action.</p>

			Anime whose main character(s) are samurai, the old, but not forgotten, warrior cast of medieval Japan.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Sci-Fi:</strong>
			Anime where the setting is based on the technology and tools of a scientifically imaginable world.

		<p><strong>Slice of Life</strong>
			Anime with no clear central plot. This anime tends to be naturalistic and mainly focuses around the main characters and their everyday lives. Often there will be some philosophical perspectives regarding love, relationships, life etc. tied into the anime.
