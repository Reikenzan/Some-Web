	  <h3>Most Common Genres</h3>
		<p><strong>Action:</strong>
			Plays out mainly through a clash of physical forces. Frequently these stories have fast cuts, tough characters making quick decisions and usually a beautiful girl nearby. Anything quick and most likely a thin storyline.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Adventure:</strong>
			Exploring new places, environments or situations. This is often associated with people on long journeys to places far away encountering amazing things, usually not in an epic but in a rather gripping and interesting way.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Cars:</strong>
			Anime whose central theme revolves around cars and probably car races. A single character's obsession for cars does not mean that it should belong to this genre. Most of these stories also are in the action genre.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Comedy:</strong>
			Multiple characters and/or events causing hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Dementia:</strong>
			Anime that have mind-twisting plots.</p>

		<p><strong>Demons:</strong>
			Anime that are set in a world where demons and other dark creatures play a significant role - the main character may even be one.</p> 

		<p><strong>Drama:</strong>
			Anime that often show life or characters through conflict and emotions. In general, the different parts of the story tend to form a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, the story has a message that is bigger than just the story line itself.</p>

		<p><strong>Ecchi:</strong>
			Anime that contain a lot of sexual innuendo. The translation of this letter (Ecchi is the letter 'H' in Japanese) is pervert. Ecchi is about panties (pantsu) and bra/breast showing, situations with "sudden nudity" and of course, subtle hints or sexual thoughts. Ecchi does not describe actual sex acts or show any intimate body parts except for bare breasts and buttocks. Ecchi is almost always used for humor.</p>

		<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong>
			Anime that are set in a mythical world quite different from modern-day Earth. Frequently this world has magic and/or mythical creatures such as dragons and unicorns. These stories are sometimes based on real world legends and myths. Frequently fantasies describe tales featuring magic, brave knights, damsels in distress, and/or quests.</p>

		<p><strong>Game:</strong>
			Anime whose central theme is based on a non-violent, non-sports game, like go, chess, trading card games or computer/video games.</p>

		<p><strong>Harem:</strong>
			Anime that involves one lead male character and many cute/pretty female support characters. Typically, the male lead ends up living with many female support characters within the same household. The lead male typically represents the average guy who is shy, awkward, and girlfriendless. While each female character surround the lead male possesses distinct physical and personality traits, those traits nevertheless represent different stereotypical roles that play on popular Japanese fetishes; i.e. the librarian/genius, tomboy, little sister, and older woman.
