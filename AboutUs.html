   <h1> About Us!</h1>
   <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
	<p>Our group is composing an animal website dedicated to finding a happy and sustainable home for abandoned and unwanted animals in the New York State area. Our affiliates at Dick Enterprises locate and nurse to health if necessary abandoned and unwanted animals as well as strays that need a home. We have quite a diverse venue of animals prospective clients are capable of choosing from.</p>
	<p>Our website will house a system of users each of whom will possess a name, ID, contact information, and a financial sum they’re willing to pay for the upkeep of the animal once it is acquired. We aren’t responsible for the animal once it is procured from us, and different animals have differing costs that come with taking care of it. Financially speaking for instance, a certain dog species may be more costly to keep fed than say a certain cat species. We want our clients to be able to afford their choice of animal so as to curb future cases of animal abandonment for financial reasons. As such, users will be unable to acquire a pet, or bundle of pets whose value(s) exceed the amount the user has allotted they’re willing to pay in expenses.</p>

	<p>Our database of pets will cycle through a simple table, updating the data within the table at the press of a button on client’s side. In the end, they will be able to browse and add pets to their shopping cart and proceed to a checkout environment where the financial needs of the pet(s) will be verified to have been met and a confirmation email will be sent to the client.</p>
